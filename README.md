# Visualizing Data with Leaflet

## Background:

The United States Geological Survey, or USGS (for short) is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Our task is to deploy new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. 

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. Their hope is that being able to visualize their data will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding..) on issues facing our planet.

## Getting the data set:

The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. We visited the USGS GeoJSON Feed page and picked a data set to visualize. We chose 'All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days'. The URL of this JSON to pull in the data for our visualization is https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson
